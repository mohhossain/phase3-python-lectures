# Sequence Types
#Note: use print() to execute the examples. Comment out examples after they've been demoed.

# Creating Lists
#1. âœ… Create a list of 10 pet names
pet_names = ['Rose', 'Meow Meow Beans', 'Mr.Legumes', 'Luke', 'Lea', 'Princess Grace', 'Spot', 'Tom', 'Mini', 'Paul']

# Reading Information From Lists
#2. âœ… Return the first pet name 


#3. âœ… Return all pet names beginning from the 3rd index


#4. âœ… Return all pet names before the 3rd index


#5. âœ…  Return all pet names beginning from the 3rd index and up to the 7th


#6. âœ… Find the index of a given element


#7. âœ… Reverse the original list


#8. âœ… Return the frequency of a given element 


# Updating Lists
#9. âœ… Change the first element to all uppercase 


#10. âœ… Append a new name to the list


#11. âœ… Add a new name at a specific index


#12. âœ… Add two lists together 


#13. âœ… Remove the final element from the list


#14. âœ… Remove element by specific index


#15. âœ… Remove a specific element 


#16. âœ… Remove all pet names from the list


#Tuple 
# ðŸ“š Review With Students:
    # Mutable, Immutable, Changeable, Unchangeable

#17. âœ… Create a Tuple of pet 10 ages 


#18. âœ… Print the first pet age


# Testing Changeability 
#19. âœ… Attempt to remove an element with ".pop" (should error)


#20. âœ… Attempt to change the first element (should error)


# Tuple Methods
#21. âœ… Return the frequency of a given element


#22. âœ… Return the index of a given element 


#23. âœ… Create a Range 
#Note:  Ranges are primarily used in loops


# Demo Sets (Stretch Goal)
#24. âœ… Create a set of 3 pet foods


# Demo Dictionaries 
# Creating 
#25. âœ…  Create a dictionary of pet information with the keys "name", "age" and "breed"
pet_info_rose = {'name':'rose','age':11,'breed':'domestic long '}


#26. âœ…  Use dict to create a dictionary of pet information with the keys "name", "age" and "breed"
pet_info_spot = dict(name='Spot', age=25, breed='boxer')


# Reading
#27. âœ… Print the pet attribute of "name" using bracket notation 


#28. âœ… Print the pet attribute of "age" using ".get"
#Note: ".get" is preferred over bracket notation in most cases because it will return "None" instead of an error


# Updating 
#29. âœ… Update the pets age to 12


#30. âœ… Update the other pets age to 26


# Deleting
#30. âœ… Delete a pets age using the "del" keyword 


#31. âœ… Delete the other pets age using ".pop"


#32. âœ… Delete the last item in the pet dictionary using "popitem()"


# Demo Loops 
pet_info = [
    {
        'name':'rose',
        'age':11,
        'breed': 'domestic long-haired',
    }, 
    {
        'name':'spot',
        'age':25,
        'breed': 'boxer',
    },
    {
        'name':'Meow Meow Beans',
        'age':2,
        'breed': 'domestic long-haired',
    }
    ]

#33. âœ… Loop through a range of 10 and print every number within the range


#34. âœ… Loop through a range between 50 and 60 that iterates by 2 and print every number


#35. âœ… Loop through the "pet_info" list and print every dictionary 


#36. âœ… Create a function that takes a list as an argument 
    # The function should use a "for" loop to loop through the list and print every item 
    # Invoke the function and pass it "pet_names" as an argument


#37. âœ… Create a function that takes a list as an argument. (simple example) 
    # The function should define a counter and set it to 0
    # Create a "while" loop 
        # The loop will continue as long as the counter is less than the length of the list
        # Every loop should increase the count by 1
    # Return the counter 


#38. âœ… Create a function that updates the age of a given pet
        # The function should take a list of "dict"s, "name" and "age" as parameters 
        # Create am index variable and set it to 0
        # Create a while loop 
            # The loop will continue so long as the list does not contain a name matching the "name" param and the index is less then the length of the list
            # Every list will increase the index by 1
        # If the dict containing a matching name is found, update the item's age with the new age 
            # Otherwise, return 'pet not found'


# map like 
#39. âœ… Use list comprehension to return a list containing every pet name from "pet_info" changed to uppercase


# find like
#40. âœ… Use list comprehension to find a pet named spot


# filter like
#41. âœ… Use list comprehension to find all of the pets under 3 years old


#43. âœ… Create a generator expression matching the filter above. Compare and contrast the generator to the list comprehension.
